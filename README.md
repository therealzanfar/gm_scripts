# Greasemonkey Script Repository

A collection of my Greasemonkey (user.js) scripts.

This repo is for my personal use and only provided as a courtesy. See the
individual scripts for their descriptions.

Feel free to open an issue or submit a PR, but it's unlikely that I will spend
any significant effort on maintaining this code for others. I appreciate
submissions in good faith, but I'm not making any promises.

# Installation

To install a script, click on the "Raw" link in the upper-right corner of the
script's page. Greasemonkey should prompt you to install the script.
